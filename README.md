# AIN (Artificial Intelligence Note) File Manifest

The **AIN** file format serves as a structured container for notes, instructions, prompts, pseudo code, and tasks to be processed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Below is the manifest that defines the purpose, structure, and guidelines for creating and using **AIN** files.

## 1. Purpose
The **AIN** file is designed to store:
- Prompts
- Pseudo code
- General notes
These contents are intended for AI to process in order to generate code, solve problems, or accomplish tasks. It serves as the primary reference for AI to understand what needs to be done.

## 2. Content
Each **AIN** file should contain clearly defined tasks, algorithms, instructions, and input data that AI can process to generate the desired results. It serves as the primary reference for AI to understand what needs to be done.

## 3. Structure
The file should be structured in a readable and logical way, with distinct sections such as:
- Task description
- Implementation details
- Expected outputs
- Input/Output examples
- Prompts and pseudo code

## 4. Preferred Formats
The **AIN** file can be created in any of the following formats:
- **YAML** – for structured, easy-to-read data representation
- **Markdown (MD)** – for detailed instructions and readable notes
- **Text (TXT)** – for plain, unformatted text or simple instructions
- **JSON** – for structured, machine-readable data and task parameters

## 5. Clarity
Instructions inside the **AIN** file must be clear and unambiguous. This ensures that AI can correctly interpret and perform the task according to the outlined expectations.

## 6. Modularity
Content in the **AIN** file should be modular, allowing individual tasks, algorithms, and data sets to be easily edited or extended without affecting the entire structure.

## 7. Examples
**AIN** files should include examples of input and output data to provide context and help AI understand the task better. This enhances the model's performance and ensures expected results.

## 8. Flexibility
The **AIN** file format can be used for a wide range of applications, from generating code to solving mathematical problems or creating content. It is flexible and can be tailored to specific needs.

## 9. Collaboration
The **AIN** file format facilitates collaboration between humans and AI, acting as a bridge that translates human intentions into algorithmic processing by AI. It allows both parties to communicate effectively.

## 10. Compatibility
**AIN** files should be compatible with popular AI tools like GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, and custom AI models, enabling easy integration and use across various platforms and environments.
