The .AIN (Artificial Intelligence Note) format is a lightweight, human-readable file format designed for storing instructions, prompts, and pseudo-code that guide AI models in performing tasks. It is optimized for clarity and simplicity, ensuring that both humans and machines can easily interpret the content.

Key Features:
	•	Human-Readable: The format is designed to be simple, making it easy to write, read, and edit by both developers and AI systems.
	•	Data Structure: It uses clear, minimal syntax, typically comprising instructions, tasks, and examples that AI can process.
	•	Versatility: .AIN files are versatile and can be used for a wide range of AI tasks, including code generation, problem-solving, and data processing.
	•	Preferred Formats: The format can be saved in plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md), YAML (.yaml), or JSON (.json) for easy integration with various tools and platforms.

Basic Structure:
	•	Instructions/Prompts: Each .AIN file contains concise instructions for AI, describing the task and providing examples or details.
	•	Syntax: The syntax is simple, with minimal use of special characters to avoid complexity and improve readability.
	•	Example:
	•	Markdown format for easy documentation.
	•	YAML for structured data representation.
	•	JSON for machine-readable input.

This minimalist approach ensures that .AIN files are easy to integrate with AI workflows and adaptable to various development environments.
